## Reflection Questions
1. A Docker image is a template that has the application code, libraries, dependencies, and configurations while a Docker container is an instance of the Docker image that runs the application.

2. Dockerâ€™s layered architecture improves efficiency because layers are cached and reused, only changed layers need to be rebuilt, and common layers are shared between images.

3. Each container gets its own writable layer so it can modify its own files without affecting the original image and other containers.

4. Docker Compose allows you to configure and manage multi-container applications using YAML file and creates a network for the containers to communicate.
